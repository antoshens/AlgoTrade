    Attributes
    ----------
    P : np.ndarray
        Pick/transition matrix of shape (K, N) mapping K investor views
        to the N assets in the portfolio universe.
    Q : np.ndarray
        Expected outperformance/return vector of shape (K, 1) corresponding
        to each view.
    Omega : np.ndarray
        Diagonal covariance/uncertainty matrix of shape (K, K) representing
        the variance associated with each view.
    valid_views : list[AssetView]
        List of view objects that were successfully validated and mapped to
        the asset universe.
    aggregation_date : str
        Effective date (`as_of_date`) of the source market views report.

    """
    Translate a market views report into Black-Litterman matrices P, Q, and Omega.

    Filters incoming views against the universe of assets and constructs:
    - Matrix P (pick matrix): rows with 1 for absolute views, or 1 and -1
      for relative pairs.
    - Vector Q (expected returns): expected outperformance for each valid view.
    - Matrix Omega (view uncertainty): diagonal matrix with variance computed
      using the view's confidence level and prior covariance scaled by tau:
      Omega_k = (p_k @ (tau * cov_matrix) @ p_k.T) * ((1 - confidence) / confidence).

    Parameters
    ----------
    report : MarketViewsReport
        The market views report containing the date and list of asset views.
    assets : pd.Index
        Index of asset tickers defining the portfolio universe (dimension N).
    cov_matrix : np.ndarray
        Asset return covariance matrix of shape (N, N).
    tau : float, optional
        Uncertainty scalar for the prior equilibrium distribution, by default 0.05.

    Returns
    -------
    TranslatedViews | None
        An instance of TranslatedViews containing matrices P, Q, Omega,
        valid views, and aggregation date, or None if no valid views were found.
